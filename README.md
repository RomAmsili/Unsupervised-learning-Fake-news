# Unsupervised-learning : Fake-news

# Unsupervised learning-Fake news detection

This notebook is an implementation of unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect fake news. The model is trained on a dataset of news articles, and it uses different features to identify the fake news from the real ones.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, you will need to have the following installed:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python 3
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn

The notebook is divided into the following sections:
1. Data Preparation
2. Features Extraction
3. Models Comparison
4. Evaluation

You can run the code by executing each cell in order.

## Data

The dataset used in this notebook is a collection of news articles scraped from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset). The dataset contains both fake and real news articles.

## Results

The model was able to achieve high accuracy in detecting the fake news. The best model was the K-means clustering algorithm with an accuracy of 87%

## Conclusion

The Unsupervised learning-Fake news notebook provides a glimpse into how unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to detect fake news. Additionally, this notebook can be used as a starting point for experimenting with different techniques, hyperparameters, or datasets to improve the quality of the detection.
