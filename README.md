Cluster fake news using k-means and visualize the clustering using PCA.

Import the Fake News Dataset from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the Account tab of your user profile and select Create API Token. This will trigger the download of kaggle.json, a file containing your API credentials.
